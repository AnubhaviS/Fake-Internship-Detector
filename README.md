#Fake_Internship_Detector

I built this project after seeing many fake internship postings online. Some of them ask for money, some promise unrealistic salaries, and some don’t even provide proper company details.

This project checks internship descriptions and tries to detect whether they look suspicious or not using basic rule-based logic.
It scans for things like:
 * Suspicious keywords (registration fee, pay to apply, etc.)
 * Unrealistic salary claims
 * Missing company information
 * Generic email domains

   
Based on these checks, it gives a basic risk indication.

Tech Used : 
 * Python
 * String handling
 * Conditional logic
 * Regex
